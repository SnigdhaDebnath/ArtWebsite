               <h3>Funnily enough I didn’t connect with or really “see” mandalas up until a few years ago!
                    But the instant I “discovered” them, I haven’t been able to stop drawing.And I absolutely fell in love!
                    When I started drawing these mandalas, something happened. I found space. Space within me. 
                    Also something deep inside started to blossom. My love for drawing and art resurfaced.But it wasn’t all that easy in the beginning. When I started I couldn’t draw a straight line – they were always crooked. 
                    I couldn’t draw a round circle, they were always distorted.Now they have improved and for this I’m so happy! “Practise makes better” And now I’ve had the opportunity to share and show my own mandala art with the world, which is totally mind-blowing considering where and how I started.
